# Oort base controller classes.
All controllers in Oort utilize Flask Classful and use it as a base class. Oort utilizes inheritance to create various base controllers to establish clear design patterns and eliminate repetative code.

Application developers should not modify these classes. If you find there are problems or deficiencies with the classes, please submit a pull request to https://github.com/dcloutman/oort-web-framework/
